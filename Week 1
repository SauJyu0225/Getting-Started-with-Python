# Getting-Started-with-Python

These are my notes for [**_Programming for Everybody (Getting Started With Python) on Coursera_**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python)

## Notes

### **_Week 1_**

#### **1.1 Why Program**  
not been recorded

#### **1.2 Hardware Overview**

1. When you write a program, you create a file on the secondary memory, like a Python file, and then at some point that is loaded into the main memory, translated, and then your program is here. And then when the CPU says what next, your program feeds its first instruction. And then when that's done, the CPU says what's next? It feeds the second instruction, third instruction, fourth instruction. It's called the **fetch-execute cycle**.

2. Definitions  

   (1) **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Runs the program - The CPU id always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but very very fast.  
   (2) **Input Devices**: Keyboard, Mouse, Touch Screen  
   (3) **Output Devices**: Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner  
   (4) **Main Memory**: **Fast small temporary storage** - lost on reboot - aka RAM  
   (5) **Secondary Memory**: **Slower large permanent storage** - lasts untill deleted - disk drive/memory stick  

#### **1.3 Python as a Language**

1. Syntax Error: Python is lost.
