# Getting-Started-with-Python

These are my notes for [**_Programming for Everybody (Getting Started With Python) on Coursera_**](https://www.coursera.org/)

## Notes

### **_Week 1_**

#### **1.1 Why Program**  
not been recorded

#### **1.2 Hardware Overview**

1. When you write a program, you create a file on the secondary memory, like a Python file, and then at some point that is loaded into the main memory, translated, and then your program is here. And then when the CPU says what next, your program feeds its first instruction. And then when that's done, the CPU says what's next? It feeds the second instruction, third instruction, fourth instruction. It's called the **fetch-execute cycle**.

2. Definitions  
(1) **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Runs the program - The CPU id always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but very very fast.  
(2) **Input Devices**: Keyboard, Mouse, Touch Screen  
(3) **Output Devices**: Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner  
(4) **Main Memory**: **Fast small temporary storage** - lost on reboot - aka RAM  
(5) **Secondary Memory**: **Slower large permanent storage** - lasts untill deleted - disk drive/memory stick  

#### **1.3 Python as a Language**
1. Syntax Error: Python is lost.

### **_Week 2_**

#### Demonstration: Using the Python Playground

1.  
   ```python
   print('Play!')
   print('Hello World.')
   ```

2. Installing Python and writing a program:
  
   **Step 1:** Install **Python3** and **Visual Studio Code**  
   **Step 2:**
   Open **Visual Studio Code**.  
   Create and save a new file on your **desktop**.  
   Also, create a folder on your desktop named **_py4e_**.  
   I svae the file as **_HelloWorld.py_**.  

   **Step 3:** Write the code in Visual Studio Code:
   ```python
   print('hello from a file')
   ```
   **Step 4:** Open Terminal (for Mac) aand write code:
   ```
   cd ~/Desktop/py4e
   python HelloWorld.py
   ```

#### 1.4 Writing paragraphs of code

1. Elements of Python  
(1) Vocabulary/Words: Variables and Reserved words  
(2) Sentence structure: valid syntax patterns  
(3) Story structure: constructing a prigram for a purpose  

2. Reserved words  
You cannot use **reserved words** as variable names/identifiers.
   ```py
   False class return is finally
   None if for lambda continue
   True def from while nonlocal
   and del global not with
   as elif try or yield
   assert else import pass
   break except in raise
   ```

3. Sentences or Lines  
   ```
   Assignment statement
   x = 2
   ```
   ```
   Assignment with expression
   x = x + 2
   ```

   ```
   Print function
   print(x)
   ```

   ```
   Variable Operator Constant Function
   ```

4. Python scripts  
   (1) interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines long.  
   (2) Most programs are much longer, so we type them into a file anf tell Python to run the commands in the file.  
   (3) In a sense, we are "giving Python a script".  
   (4) As a convention, we ad **".py"** as the suffix on the end of these files to indicate they contain Python.  

5. Interactive versus Script  
   (1) Interactive: you type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds.  
   (2) Script: you enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file.  

6. Program steps or Program flow  
   (1) Like a recipe or installation instrcutions, a program is a **sequence** of steps to be done in order.  
   (2) Some steps are **conditional**: they may be skipped.  
   (3) Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be **repeated**.  
   (4) Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program.  

7. Sequential Steps
   ```
   x = 2
   print(x)
   x = x + 2
   print(x)
   ```
