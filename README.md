# Getting-Started-with-Python

These are my notes for [**_Programming for Everybody (Getting Started With Python) on Coursera_**](https://www.coursera.org/)

## Notes
* **_Week 1_**

<br> [1.1 Why Program]
<br> not been recorded

<br> [1.2 Hardware Overview]
1. When you write a program, you create a file on the secondary memory, like a Python file, and then at some point that is loaded into the main memory, translated, and then your program is here. And then when the CPU says what next, your program feeds its first instruction. And then when that's done, the CPU says what's next? It feeds the second instruction, third instruction, fourth instruction. It's called the **fetch-execute cycle**.
2. Definitions
<br> (1) **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**: Runs the program - The CPU id always wondering "what to do next". Not the brains exactly - very dumb but very very fast.
<br> (2) **Input Devices**: Keyboard, Mouse, Touch Screen
<br> (3) **Output Devices**: Screen, Speakers, Printer, DVD Burner
<br> (4) **Main Memory**: **Fast small temporary storage** - lost on reboot - aka RAM
<br> (5) **Secondary Memory**: **Slower large permanent storage** - lasts untill deleted - disk drive/memory stick

<br> [1.3 Python as a Language]
1. Syntax Error: Python is lost.


* **_Week 2_**

<br> [Demonstration: Using the Python Playground]

1.
```python
print('Play!')
print('Hello World.')
```
2. Installing Python and writing a program:

Step 1 Install **Python3** and **Visual Studio Code**

Step 2 
Open **Visual Studio Code**. 
Create and save a new file on your **desktop**. 
Also, create a folder on your desktop named **_py4e_**.
I svae the file as **_HelloWorld.py_**.

Step 3 Write the code in Visual Studio Code:
```python
print('hello from a file')
```
Step 4 Open Terminal (for Mac) aand write code:
  ```
cd ~/Desktop/py4e
python HelloWorld.py
```
<br> [1.4 Writing paragraphs of code]
1. Elements of Python
<br> (1) Vocabulary/Words: Variables and Reserved words
<br> (2) Sentence structure: valid syntax patterns
<br> (3) Story structure: constructing a prigram for a purpose
